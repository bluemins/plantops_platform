# WhatsApp chat: a clearer conversation with customers — plan

**Status:** plan, written 2026-10-24. **Owner's decisions given 2026-10-25: 1a 2a 3a 4a 5 yes 6 me 7a** (all as
recommended; section 7). No code yet; next: the Odia column (section 10, the owner writes it) and the 14 Twilio
templates (section 9). TODO #1; to be live **before 2026-11-09**, when the first reorder reminders lead customers into
this chat.

**Where:** the bot repo only (`~/projects/order_handoff`). Based on the bot's code (`src/app.js`, `texts.js`,
`messages.js`, `catalog.js`, `commands.js`) and the Sheet logs `Message_Logs` / `Sessions_Log` (13 Sep–24 Oct).

## 1. What does NOT change

The conversation changes; how orders are handled does not.

- **Order Capture:** no change. The bot keeps calling the same three things it uses today: the customer lookup, create
  order (same idempotency key, same YES rule), and the consent answer. No new endpoint, no schema, no new setting.
- **Orders:** still created only after an exact YES on the summary; the reference (O-00xx) only after Order Capture
  answers. Staff, the order list, notifications, CSV and the tile see bot orders exactly as today.
- **Reminders and consent:** Order Capture still sends the reminder; the bot still asks the reminder question once
  after an order, and STOP / START work as today. The pilot's groups and caps are untouched.
- **Delivery thank-you:** still sent only by Order Capture. The bot only *answers* when a customer taps its buttons.
- **Unknown numbers, Order Capture down, `BOT_ORDERS=off`:** still the Sheet `lead` path ("our team will call").
- **No AI.** Fixed menus, fixed words, fixed steps.
- **The bot never sends a message on its own.** Every change below is a reply to something the customer sent.

## 2. Today's chat (owner's phone, 24 Oct)

| # | Customer | Bot | Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Order | "Your last order (24 Oct): 5 box Bluemins 1L … Reply REPEAT …, or tap a size below." + size buttons | English + Odia |
| 2 | taps 1L | "Bluemins 1L ବାଛ୍ ଲେ ଆପଣ .. କେତେଟା ବକ୍ସ୍ …" | Odia |
| 3 | 10 | "ଆଉ କିଛି ଲାଗବା …?" + buttons | Odia |
| 4 | taps "ଆଉ ନାଇଁ ଲାଗେ କିଛି" | "Where should we deliver? Type a landmark …, or SKIP." | English |
| 5 | Near shiva temple | "Please check your order: … Reply YES …, EDIT …, or CANCEL." | English |
| 6 | Yes | "Thank you. Your order O-0072 is placed …" + "Would you like … reminder …? Reply 1 / 2" | English |
| 7 | 1 | "Thank you. We will send you a reminder …" | English |

Six replies from "Order" to a placed order, seven with the reminder question; the language switches three times.
Even with REPEAT, a known customer needs four replies (Order → REPEAT → landmark → YES).

## 3. What goes wrong (logs + code)

| # | What happened | Cause in the code | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Lost order** (…155459, 20 Sep): 250 ml × 10, then typed "500ml", "Another size", "500 ml / 1 l" (one message), "1", "10", then stopped | At "anything more?" a typed size isn't understood (only *more* / *done*); two sizes in one message aren't understood; "1" was read as 1 L | The customer gave up with a full basket; nobody knew |
| P2 | **Got nowhere** (…018508, 9 Oct): "Hii", "Rate", "Hindi", "Massage Kari", "Majalgaon", "??" | No answer for a price question, a language request or a place; every message → "Say 'Hi' to start" | Two misses → "passed to our team" (Majalgaon is in Maharashtra: outside the area) |
| P3 | **Thank-you buttons ignored**: 5 customers tapped "Okay" / "Great" on the delivery thank-you | Those buttons aren't known to the bot → "Say 'Hi' to start placing an order." (logged *unrecognised*) | The happiest customers get a confusing answer; a second tap → "passed to our team" + a staff alert for nothing |
| P4 | "Repeat" right after an order; "Not great" outside the feedback questions | REPEAT only works inside the size picker; feedback buttons only inside feedback | *unrecognised* |
| P5 | **Mixed languages** in one order | Order steps' Odia texts (old `messages.js`, Twilio templates) + Step 1–4 texts in English only (`texts.js`) | An Odia-only customer is lost at the landmark and the summary |
| P6 | Chats that stop after "Hi" | The welcome (Twilio template `CONTENT_SID_INTRO`) | Unclear what to do next (mostly tests, but the same for real customers) |
| P7 | Small gaps | YES needs the exact word (not "ok", "haan"); greetings only *hi / hello / hey* (not "namaskar", "johar"); Odia digits (୧୦) not read as numbers | *unrecognised* → handoff |

## 4. The plan: five changes

### C1 — One language per chat
- Every text the bot sends lives in one place (`texts.js`), each in **Odia and English**.
- The chat runs in **one language from start to end**. Default: **Odia**. The customer switches with a word or button:
  *English* / *ଓଡ଼ିଆ*. The choice is kept for the phone number (Redis, 1 year; no Order Capture change).
- **The Odia wording comes from the owner (or staff)**, in the plant's own Sambalpuri Odia, like today's order
  messages. I draft the English and the list of lines; I don't invent Odia text.
- The reminder message itself (Order Capture's Twilio template) stays as approved.

### C2 — Fewer steps for a known customer
- **"Order" from a customer with a last order** → one message: *"Same as last time? 5 box 1L, near Shiva temple"* with
  buttons **Same again** / **Change**. *Same again* goes straight to the summary → YES. **3 replies** instead of 6
  (Order → Same again → YES).
- **Landmark remembered:** the last landmark a customer typed is kept by the bot (Redis, per phone, 180 days) and
  offered next time: *"Deliver near Shiva temple again?"* **Yes** / type a new one. It still goes to Order Capture in the
  order note, as today. (The customer can always type a new one.)
- The reminder's **"Order again"** button uses the same short path.
- New sizes / changes keep today's steps (size → quantity → anything more?).

### C3 — Understand more of what people type
- **At "anything more?":** a typed size starts that size ("500ml" → quantity for 500 ml). Fixes P1.
- **Size + quantity in one message:** "500ml 10", "10 box 1L", and several lines ("500 ml 10 / 1 l 5") → all added,
  then "anything more?". Anything unclear → ask only for the unclear part.
- **Numbers:** "10", "10 box", "10 boxes", Odia digits ୧୦.
- **YES:** *yes, ok, okay, haan, ha, ହଁ, ହ, confirm*. (Order Capture still gets the same create call; only the words the
  bot accepts grow. "ok" was a Step 3 leftover.)
- **Greetings:** *hi, hello, hey, namaskar, namaste, johar, ଜୁହାର, ନମସ୍କାର*.
- Unknown size: the size buttons again, not an error.

### C4 — Never a dead end
| Customer sends | Today | Planned reply |
|---|---|---|
| Taps **Okay / Great / Not great** on the thank-you | "Say 'Hi' to start…" → second time a staff alert | Saved as that delivery's rating (Feedback tab, like the feedback questions; the buttons already send the same ids `okay` / `great` / `not_great`), then "Thank you! Send ORDER whenever you need water again." *Not great* → the existing "Not great" staff alert |
| "Repeat" / "order" right after placing | *unrecognised* | "Your order O-00xx is placed. Send ORDER for another one." |
| **Rate / price / ଦାମ / dam** | *unrecognised* | "Prices depend on the order: our team will call you with today's price. Send ORDER to place one, or PERSON to talk to us." (no prices in the bot, as decided) |
| **Hindi / English / ଓଡ଼ିଆ** | *unrecognised* | Switches the language (Hindi: see decision 2) |
| Anything else, first time | "Say 'Hi' to start…" | The welcome menu (C5) |
| Anything else, second time | handoff + alert | handoff + alert (as today, so a real question still reaches staff) |

### C5 — A clear welcome
"Hi" (or anything unclear when no chat is open) → one short message with **numbered choices and buttons**:
1 **Order water** · 2 **Same as last time** (only if there is a last order) · 3 **Talk to us** · 4 **Feedback**.
Typing the number works too. The welcome and the size / "anything more?" buttons are **Twilio Content templates**:
changing them is a Twilio setting (decision 5). Replies inside a chat don't need Meta approval.

## 5. Not in this plan
- AI, free conversation, prices in the bot.
- New customers ordering into Order Capture (area list): waits until the bot takes new customers (build plan).
- Marketing or festival messages (need consent + approved templates; only the reminder pilot sends first).
- Any Order Capture or PlantOps change.

## 6. How we build and check it
1. **Decisions + Odia text** (owner, section 7): by ~28 Oct.
2. **Build** in the bot repo with tests for every line in sections 3–4 (the 20 Sep lost order and the 9 Oct chat are
   replayed as tests). Release 3.5.0 on `main`; nothing goes live by pushing `main`.
3. **Live** when the owner says so (~1 Nov): `production` push, then the owner's phone test: Hi, Order, Same again,
   a typed "500ml 10", thank-you button, Rate, English / ଓଡ଼ିଆ, YES as "ok". Undo = the previous commit.
4. **Measure** from `Sessions_Log` (2 weeks before vs after): chats from "Order" to a placed order, *unrecognised* per
   week, handoffs, replies per order. Group counts only.

## 7. Decisions for the owner (my recommendation first)

**Decided by the owner 2026-10-25: 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5 yes, 6 the owner writes the Odia, 7a.**
1. **Language:** (a) **Odia first, English on request** *(recommended: most customers are local)* · (b) English first ·
   (c) ask at the start (one more step).
2. **Hindi:** (a) **not now** *(recommended: one Hindi request so far, from outside the area; add when needed)* ·
   (b) add Hindi now (needs Hindi text too).
3. **Remember the last landmark** (bot Redis, 180 days): (a) **yes, offer it next time** *(recommended: saves a step
   every order)* · (b) ask every time.
4. **Price question:** (a) **"our team will call with today's price"** *(recommended: no Order Capture change, prices
   stay with staff)* · (b) show the default rate (would need an Order Capture change: not in this plan).
5. **Twilio templates** (welcome, size picker, "anything more?"): may I change them in Twilio when we go live?
   *(recommended: yes; I prepare the new text and steps, you click save in Twilio, the old ones stay as backup)*
6. **Odia text:** who writes it? *(recommended: you or a staff member who writes to customers today; I send the list of
   lines in English with today's Odia next to each, ~25 short lines)*

---

## 8. The conversation, message by message

`[buttons]` = tap buttons (a Twilio template, section 9); everything else is plain text. Each line exists in Odia and
English (C1); English shown here. **T-codes** are the Twilio templates of section 9; **M-codes** are plain texts the
bot sends itself (no Twilio work, only the Odia wording, section 10).

### A. Known customer, same as last time (the common case — 3 replies)
| Who | Message |
|---|---|
| Customer | Hi *(or Order, Johar, Namaskar…)* |
| Bot **T1** | "Johar Rocky! What would you like?" `[Same as last time] [New order] [Talk to us]` |
| Customer | taps **Same as last time** |
| Bot **M1** | the summary: "Please check your order: Rocky, Bijepur · Bluemins 1L (1 L × 12): 5 box · Deliver near: Shiva temple · Our team will call you about the price." |
| Bot **T7** | "Place this order?" `[YES] [EDIT] [CANCEL]` |
| Customer | taps **YES** *(or types yes / ok / haan / ହଁ)* |
| Bot **M2** | "Thank you. Your order O-0073 is placed. Our team will call you about the price and delivery." |
| Bot **T8** | *(only the first time, as today)* "Would you like a WhatsApp reminder when it may be time to order again? You can send STOP at any time." `[Yes, remind me] [No thanks]` |
| Customer | taps one → **M3** "Thank you. We will remind you…" / **M4** "Okay, no reminders. Thank you." |

*No landmark question:* the last landmark is reused and shown on the summary (decision 3). EDIT → path B.

### B. Known customer, new basket (or EDIT)
| Who | Message |
|---|---|
| Customer | taps **New order** (or EDIT, or the reminder's "Change order") |
| Bot **T4** | "Which size?" `[1L box (12)] [500ml box (24)] [250ml box (35)]` |
| Customer | taps **500ml** *(or types "500ml", "2", or "500ml 10" = size + quantity at once, C3)* |
| Bot **M5** | "How many boxes of 500 ml? (1, 2, 5 …)" |
| Customer | 10 *(or "10 box", ୧୦)* |
| Bot **T5** | "Added 10 box 500 ml. Anything more?" `[Add another size] [That's all]` |
| Customer | taps **That's all** *(typing "1L 5" here adds 1 L × 5 instead, C3)* |
| Bot **T6** | "Deliver near Shiva temple again? Or type a new landmark." `[Yes, same place] [Skip]` *(no last landmark: **M6** "Where should we deliver? Type a landmark, or SKIP.")* |
| Customer | taps **Yes, same place** or types a new landmark |
| Bot | **M1** summary + **T7** `[YES] [EDIT] [CANCEL]` → as in A |

### C. Number not in Order Capture (new customer) or ordering switched off
| Who | Message |
|---|---|
| Customer | Hi |
| Bot **T2** | "Johar! Bluemins packaged drinking water. What would you like?" `[Order water] [Talk to us] [Feedback]` |
| Customer | **Order water** → sizes and quantities as in B (T4 → M5 → T5) |
| Bot **M7** | "What name should we write for this order?" → **M8** "Where should we deliver? Village / landmark." |
| Bot **M9** | summary + "Reply YES …" → YES → **M10** "Thank you. We have noted your order. Our team will call you to confirm it." *(Sheet `lead`, unchanged)* |

### D. Delivery thank-you buttons (sent by Order Capture, unchanged)
| Customer taps | Bot |
|---|---|
| **Great** / **Okay** | **M11** "Thank you! Send ORDER whenever you need water again." (rating saved) |
| **Not great** | **M12** "Sorry about that. Our team will call you." (rating saved + staff alert, as the feedback flow does) |

### E. Reorder reminder buttons (Order Capture's reminder, unchanged)
| Customer taps | Bot |
|---|---|
| **Order again** (`reorder_repeat`) | summary of the last order + T7 (path A) |
| **Change order** (`reorder_edit`) | T4 sizes (path B) |
| **Stop reminders** (`optout_stop`) | **M13** today's "You will not get reminder messages…" |

### F. Questions and other messages
| Customer sends | Bot |
|---|---|
| Rate / price / ଦାମ / dam | **M14** "Prices depend on the order: our team will call you with today's price. Send ORDER to place one, or PERSON to talk to us." |
| English / ଓଡ଼ିଆ / Odia | **M15** "Okay, English from now on." / the Odia line, then the welcome (T1 / T2) in that language |
| Hindi | **M16** (decision 2 a) "Sorry, we can chat in Odia or English. Our team will call you if you need Hindi." + staff alert |
| Repeat / Order right after placing | **M17** "Your order O-0073 is placed. Send ORDER for another one." |
| Anything not understood | 1st time: the welcome (T1 / T2) · 2nd time: **M18** today's "We have passed your message to our team…" + staff alert |
| HELP · MENU · CANCEL · PERSON · STOP · START · FEEDBACK | as today (M19–M24, today's texts in both languages) |

## 9. What to create in Twilio (guide)

**Where:** Twilio Console → **Messaging → Content Template Builder → Create new**. All of these are *in-chat* messages
(the bot only sends them as a reply within 24 hours of the customer's message), so they **don't need WhatsApp / Meta
approval**: create, **Save**, and **don't** press "Submit for WhatsApp approval". Each saved template gets an id
starting with **HX…**: copy it into the list at the end.

**Rules for every template:**
- **Content type: Quick reply.** WhatsApp allows **at most 3 buttons** in a chat message, and **20 characters** per
  button title (Odia letters count too: keep titles short).
- Each button has a **title** (what the customer sees) and an **ID** (what the bot receives). **Type the IDs exactly as
  below** (small letters, underscores). Same IDs in the Odia and the English template.
- `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` are filled in by the bot. Twilio asks for a **sample value** for each: use the samples below.
  A filled-in value is always one line (no line breaks), so the summary stays a plain text message (M1).
- **Language field:** pick **English** for both versions if Odia isn't in Twilio's list (for in-chat messages it is only
  a label; what the customer sees is the text you type).
- **Names:** `bm_<what>_od` and `bm_<what>_en`, e.g. `bm_welcome_known_od`.
- **Don't delete or edit the six templates in use today** (welcome, size picker, anything more, estimator, two feedback):
  they are the way back if we have to undo. They can be deleted a month after go-live.

| Code | Template name (×2: `_od`, `_en`) | Body (English; Odia in section 10) | Buttons: title → **ID** | Variables (sample) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T1** | `bm_welcome_known` | Johar {{1}}! What would you like? | Same as last time → **menu_same** · New order → **menu_order** · Talk to us → **menu_person** | {{1}} name (Rocky) |
| **T2** | `bm_welcome_new` | Johar! Bluemins packaged drinking water. What would you like? Type ENGLISH or ଓଡ଼ିଆ to change the language. | Order water → **menu_order** · Talk to us → **menu_person** · Feedback → **menu_feedback** | — |
| **T4** | `bm_sizes` | Which size? | 1L box (12) → **PV_BM_1** · 500ml box (24) → **PV_BM_500** · 250ml box (35) → **PV_BM_250** | — |
| **T5** | `bm_more` | Added {{1}}. Anything more? | Add another size → **add_more** · That's all → **order_done** | {{1}} what was added (10 box 500 ml) |
| **T6** | `bm_landmark_again` | Deliver near {{1}} again? Or type a new landmark. | Yes, same place → **landmark_same** · Skip → **landmark_skip** | {{1}} last landmark (Shiva temple) |
| **T7** | `bm_confirm` | Place this order? | YES → **confirm_yes** · EDIT → **confirm_edit** · CANCEL → **confirm_cancel** | — |
| **T8** | `bm_optin` | Would you like a WhatsApp reminder when it may be time to order again? You can send STOP at any time. | Yes, remind me → **optin_yes** · No thanks → **optin_no** | — |

*T3 (the old "repeat offer" text) is no longer needed: "Same as last time" on T1 replaces it.*

**Total: 7 templates × 2 languages = 14.** The size buttons keep today's IDs (`PV_BM_1` …) and "anything more?" keeps
`add_more` / `order_done`, so the bot reads old and new templates the same way.

**T8 is the consent question.** Its English text is today's approved wording *(optin-v1)*, only with buttons added.
The Odia version is a new wording and is saved with each answer as **optin-v1-od** (consent records keep the wording
shown). This is a consent change: **your OK is needed** (decision 7).

**Nothing changes in Twilio for:** the delivery thank-you and the reorder reminder (Order Capture's approved
templates), the WhatsApp number, the webhook address, or the estimator / feedback templates.

**When done, send me the 14 HX ids** in this form (or a screenshot of the list). At go-live they go into **one** Railway
variable on `whatsappbot`, `CONTENT_SIDS` (I prepare the exact value, you paste it):

```
T1 od HX…   T1 en HX…
T2 od HX…   T2 en HX…
T4 od HX…   T4 en HX…
T5 od HX…   T5 en HX…
T6 od HX…   T6 en HX…
T7 od HX…   T7 en HX…
T8 od HX…   T8 en HX…
```

## 10. Odia wording to write (owner / staff)
